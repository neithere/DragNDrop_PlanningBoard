Critical basic TODOs:

- edit task inline (`text` attribute to store)
- add task
- load/send via AJAX (with at least some dumb handler)

Improvements:

- set effort points / estimates (`effort` attribute to store)
- set colour (for QA/BE/FE)

After all that â€” automated Burndown chart:

- update timestamp on task status change
- add a chart (just a table) where columns represent dates from sprint start
  to sprint end (for starters just min/max known dates), groups tasks into
  these columns by timestamp; then for each date:

      done = done_today + done_before_today
      left_today = total - done

  Note that all numbers are not task count but effort points.
  OTOH, even task count would do for now.


Prototype vision:

- In-memory DB
- full fetch on page load
- per-task save (name OR status) on related UI event
